I've noticed that TechFlow Solutions has been actively engaging in industry events recently, like the tech conference you attended last month, and exploring the latest AI trends. As a company that's clearly forward-thinking, it's essential that your brand visibility and employee retention keep pace. \n\nGiven your previous successful purchases of our custom notebooks and branded pens, I wanted to introduce our Custom Branded T-Shirts. These comfortable cotton t-shirts, embroidered or printed with TechFlow's logo, are not just cost-effective, but they also serve as a powerful tool to enhance brand visibility and foster a sense of unity among your team. \n\nIn addition to being a great uniform choice, these t-shirts are perfect for company events and team-building activities. Remember, a team that feels united and proud of their company naturally becomes ambassadors of your brand. \n\nI understand you're in the process of evaluating your options for the next 2-3 months. Why not schedule a product demo with us in the upcoming weeks? It will help you to make an informed decision within your budget range of $10,000-$25,000. \n\nLet's chat more about how these branded t-shirts can help TechFlow Solutions stand out in the bustling software development industry. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. \n\nBest Regards, \n[Your Name]",
